dotnet-sqlmetal-plus
====================

SqlMetal.exe (Code Generation Tool) command-line tool generates code and mapping for the LINQ to SQL component of the .NET Framework. This tool is automatically installed with Visual Studio. Auto generate from a database, generate an intermediate database markup language (.dbml) file for customization this is not always forced to be done and therefore SQLMetal is needed to force a regeneration. The project adds a plugin for visual studio so SQLMetal can force this regeneration with just one click.
