    <h2>
        Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        When using Linq to Sql in one of our projects, we have come across a situation 
        where we had to make lot of custom changes to the dbml file sqlmetal generates 
        such as</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Changing all lookup values to enums so that our code looks more elegent</li>
        <li>Modify the generated association member names to our own names for better 
            readability</li>
        <li>Removing unwanted tables/stored procedures</li>
        <li>etc etc </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        While trying to make all the above changes, it has become cumbersome to repeat 
        the same changes again and again when ever we regenrate the dbml.so i started 
        with writing a small script which got transformed to a vs addin finally.</p>
    <h2>
        Installing the addin</h2>
    <p>
        I have included&nbsp;wix project along with the addin source which generates the 
        msi.so just install and you are ready to go.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2>
        How it works</h2>
    <p>
        The addin looks for a xml file in the same folder as the dbml file with a name 
        as dbml file+&quot;custom.xml&quot;. so if your dbml file name is Northwind.dbml then your 
        custom mapping file should be named as &quot;northwind.dbml.custom.xml&quot;</p>

<h2>How to create custom mapping xml</h2>

<p>Just create a copy of the dbml file and rename as per the naming conventions by 
    appending with &quot;custom.xml&quot;.one advantage with this approach is Visual Studio 
    provides autocompletion for all possible attributes as well as node names.You 
    can add a custom attribute called &quot;CustomizationType&quot; which takes 
    &quot;<code>Add</code>&quot;,&quot;<code>Update</code>&quot;,&quot;<code>Delete</code>&quot; which specifies the customization you are looking after 
    for that specific node.<p>For example, if you want to make a specific column from 
        the database to be invisible in your code for what ever reason, you can update 
        the column node in the mapping file as below
<pre>
<code>
<Column CustomizationType="Delete" Name="Description" Type="System.String" DbType="VarChar(50) NOT NULL" CanBeNull="false" />
</code>
</pre>

    <p>For changing the lookup columns type to enum , you can modify the node in the 
        custom mapping file as below
<pre>
<code>
<Column Name="ProductStatusCd" Member="ProductStatus" Type="global::YourNamespace.ProductStatus" DbType="SmallInt NOT NULL" CanBeNull="false" />
</code>
</pre>

&nbsp;<p>If you observe the above custom change, i have changed the Member name also to 
        &quot;ProductStatus&quot; so in my code, i can refer this column as &quot;ProductStatus&quot; 
        instead of &quot;ProductStatusCd&quot;.<p>Similarly, you can make any custom change which 
        is allowed in the dbml by the VS designer and save the custom xml file and the 
        addin takes care of applying these changes to the final dbml file.<h2>Points of Interest</h2>

<p>Do not use the VS Desinger to create the DBML if you want to use this addin 
    because , i dont know for what reason, the association key names generated by VS 
    Designer are different to the ones generated by sqlmetal tool.sqlmetal names the 
    association keys same as the foreign key names in the database but VS designer 
    changes them to sourcetable_targettable format.As this addin relies on 
    sqlmetal.exe to generate the initial dbml, do not make any changes to the dbml 
    using vs designer.ofcourse you can open the final dbml and view the same in 
    designer to get a clear picture of what is changed and whether all changes are 
    correctly applied.
